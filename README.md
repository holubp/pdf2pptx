# pdf2pptx
Simple converter from PDF into PowerPoint PPTX via raster images.

I have created this tool in order to be able to hand over PPTX versions of my presentations created in LaTeX Beamer, where none of the coversions via Adobe Acrobat nor PowerPoint itself preserves full visual fidelity of the presentation.
